Thanks for downloading Django Phylogeny

To install, run the following command inside this directory:

	python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer, you can simply place the included ``phylogeny`` directory
somewhere on your PYTHONPATH, or symlink to it from somewhere on your
PYTHONPATH; this is useful if you're working from a git checkout.

Requirements:
 - Python 2.6 or newer
 - Django 1.3 or newer
 - Biopython 1.57 or newer
 - Django MPTT

You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/, Django from
http://www.djangoproject.com/, Biopython from http://biopython.org/, and
Django MPTT from https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt.
